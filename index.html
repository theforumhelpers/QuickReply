		<textarea class="CopyText" id="Text6" readonly>The Questions About Scratch forum is for users to ask questions and receive answers about Scratch.

		<textarea class="CopyText" id="Text8" readonly>Unfortunately, you can't change your username. The Scratch Team actually has changed a few usernames before, but only in very rare cases and only for special reasons, like if the username revealed personal information or was inappropriate; they won't change a username without a very good reason, and "I don't like my username" doesn't count as a very good reason in their eyes. In the past, they have considered making private username changes possible, but they decided against it, citing moderation concerns and the potential confusion a username change could cause in the community. For more information, read section 8.1 in the [url=https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/343602/]List of Rejected Suggestions[/url].<br><br>However, that doesn't mean you're out of options. You can choose to create a new account, transfer your current projects over by downloading/reuploading them, and make it clear that you're moving; keep in mind though that your statistics, like your follower count or the loves you've gotten on your projects, cannot be transferred over. Alternatively, if you don't want to lose those statistics, you can choose to stay with your current account and live with your username.
